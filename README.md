# Annual Christmas List

This was the first project I’ve created for real-world use instead of just for learning, and it felt different from anything I’ve worked on before. I had to think about how someone else would actually use the website and make choices that made it practical, reliable, and easy to understand. Seeing it all come together made the project feel more meaningful, because it wasn’t just another assignment — it was something my family could use every year to share Christmas gift ideas. Finishing it gave me more confidence in my ability to take on real projects and helped me understand what it takes to turn an idea into something useful.
